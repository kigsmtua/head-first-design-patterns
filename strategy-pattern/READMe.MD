Key takeway
- Does this mean we can't get to use such implementations here no ?
- This will have some values that come along and this will ensure that behaviours in those classes can be used abstractly
- Take away the parts that vary, encapsulate them such that changing them becomes a breeze
- Polymorphism (encapsulate an objects behaviour ? no ?)
- Dont program to an implementation(make our code a bit easier to refactor)
- Favor composition over inheritance
